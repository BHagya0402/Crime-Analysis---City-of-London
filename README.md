# Spatial Analysis of crime patterns in the city of London

Urbanisation in Cities contributes to economic, social, and physical transformation (Catlett et al., 2019). In addition to the opportunities in cities, urbanisation also poses multiple management challenges. One of the significant challenges the cities is the crime rate, and increasing crimes highly impact the socio-economic systems of the cities. 

According to the city's crime data, the overall crime rate in 2022 was 819 crimes per 1000 people, which is 762% higher than the overall London crime rate. This indicates that crime is one of the city's most significant challenges.

According to the 2021 census, the City of London has a population of 9,721 and is considered the most vulnerable city among all the cities in the United Kingdom. Analysing the crime patterns (Sathyadevan et al., 2014) we can identify highly vulnerable regions in urban areas, which helps in crime prevention and improving public safety. With the increase in the number of crimes, data analysis promotes awareness in the general public (Garg et al., 2018) and assists in better law enforcement.

Though it is impossible to predict the victims of crime (Sathyadevan et al., 2014),  historical and spatial crime patterns can be used to predict future crime possibilities (Pradhan et al., 2019) as a result, help better public safety. The crime analysis was accomplished in a structured Python code, and high-crime areas were identified to determine the crime hotspots by clustering and predicted by using Random Forest Regression.
